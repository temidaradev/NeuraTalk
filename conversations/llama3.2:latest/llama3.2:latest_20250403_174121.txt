You: sup

AI: Not much. How about you?

You: sup

AI: Not much, just hanging out in the digital realm. What's new with you?

You: gyat

AI: It looks like we've got a language barrier going on here!

Just to clarify, I think "sup" is a casual greeting, and "gyat" doesn't seem to be a word or phrase that I'm familiar with.

If you meant to type something else, feel free to try again!

You: eyyy

AI: I think I might have made a mistake with the "gyat"! You're right, it's not a word or phrase I'm familiar with. Let me try again.

Hey, how's your day going?
